I'm currently a student at the [University of Queensland (UQ)](https://uq.edu.au/), where I'm studying a dual degree in Engineering and Science, majoring in Software Engineering and Mathematics respectively. I am also the President of the [UQ Computing Society](https://uqcs.org.au), and have been part of the management committeee of the Society since my second year of university.

I'm employed as software developer at [Polymathian Pty. Ltd](https://polymathian.com/), a company that uses Operations Reasearch to produce decision support tools. My work is divided between doing devops for the company, and working on our Python data visualisation web framework, [Tropofy](https://tropofy.com/).
