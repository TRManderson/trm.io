I'm a professional software developer, currently working as a Software Engineer at [Cubiko](https://www.cubiko.com.au/). I am fond of Python and Haskell, DevOps, distributed systems, Operations Research (a form of mathematical decision optimisation), and formal verification of programs. I also have strong experience with JavaScript, modern C++, and Java.

I studied at the [University of Queensland (UQ)](https://uq.edu.au/), where I graduated with a dual degree in Engineering and Science, majoring in Software Engineering and Mathematics respectively. I recieved honours in Software Engineering for my thesis: "Proving Consistency of an Abstract Algebra for Verification of Concurrent Programs".
