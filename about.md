I'm currently a student in my final semester at the [University of Queensland (UQ)](https://uq.edu.au/), where I'm studying a dual degree in Engineering and Science, majoring in Software Engineering and Mathematics respectively. I am currently in the process of completing my Bachelor's degree thesis: "Proving Consistency of an Abstract Algebra for Verification of Concurrent Programs".

I also am a freelance software developer, specialising in Python and Haskell software development, DevOps, distributed systems architecture, Operations Research (a form of mathematical decision optimisation), and formal verification of programs. I also have strong experience with JavaScript, modern C++, and Java.
