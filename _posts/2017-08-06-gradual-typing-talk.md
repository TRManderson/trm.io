This weekend at PyCon I presented a talk on gradual typing in Python, specifically talking about the `typing` library from Python 3.5 onwards, and the `mypy` typechecker. The slides are [available on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_LKkvn7Xta2w2f-eX3mB4j_zHhH_0IV7yq9_O90boMU/).

The conference on the whole was absolutely fantastic, and I had a great experience as both a speaker and attendee. Looking forward to submitting a proposal for PyCon AU 2018 in Sydney!
